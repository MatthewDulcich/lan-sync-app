# LANSyncApp Addons (drop-in code)

Drag the **Addons** folder into your existing Xcode project (target: LANSyncApp). 
These files provide the missing scaffolding for networking (Bonjour + Network.framework), 
operation log, content-addressed blobs with resumable transfers, QR join, and HMAC framing.

**After adding:**
1) Add `ContextBridge()` to your `RootView` (e.g., at the bottom of the VStack) so the Replicator gets a SwiftData context:
   ```swift
   VStack { /* ... */ }
   .overlay(ContextBridge().hidden())
   ```
2) Replace the stub logic inside `SessionManager` with calls to `HostService.shared` and `VerifierService.shared` as desired.
   (You can also rename or remove the stub implementationsâ€”these Addons compile even if you keep the stubs and integrate gradually.)

The code is intentionally light and commented so you can extend features incrementally.
